About
-----

syncCto provides the ability to synchronize multiple contao installations based on a basic installation. All actions can be conveniently carried out in the backend. By integrating into the contao permission system, editors can also synchronize a selection of predefined database tables and files.

An integrated backup manager backup selected database tables, either the entire contao installation or just the personal data. Backups can be imported again.

By using syncCto editors can work quickly and easily in a preview system, and then synchronize the current and approved version to the live system. Other possible applications might include:

* Preview <-> Live
* Development <-> Preview -> Live
